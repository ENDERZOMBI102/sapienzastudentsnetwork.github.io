You might have to check the webpage in case rules change, as it happened in the 2024/25 academic year when the recommended curriculums were added.

## Study Plan Basics

Students of the Master's Degree in Computer Science must have a valid study plan ("percorso formativo") to be able to book and take exams.

A study plan for the Master Programme in Computer Science must comprise 120–123 credits, split as follows:
- 66 credits chosen from those offered within the course programme (with some restrictions, see below);
- 12–15 credits of elective teachings, chosen (in principle) from the entire Sapienza catalogue (must be justified to be approved, you can't simply insert Philosofy 3);
- 6 credits of a supplementary educational activity (in Italian: "Attività Formativa Complementare", in short "AFC"), which might be a seminary, a side project with a professor or a recognized work activity related to Computer Science (check [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRMVE88DZffehZflMrOBiBL2YV40IZ5ZA-naM3d5cZm1Sws1NS9mXGXdrRw0L4a9yObgHgnlwHNQTG8/pub);
- 36 credits of Master thesis work and defense.

### Study Plan Options

There are **two types** of study plans for the 2024/2025 academic year (you can check [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kasq5efzmuVXt2SlMfGnvn1gUD5bD877/edit) for the appendices and PCCs combinations):

1. **Recommended Study Plan ("`PERCORSO FORMATIVO CONSIGLIATO`", Based on PCCs)**  
   Automatically approved if correctly compiled:
    - Choose **two specialization areas** (PCCs) according to your interests from the following list:
        - Algorithms
        - Artificial Intelligence
        - Computational Models for Systems Design
        - Data Science
        - Multimedia Computing and Interaction
        - Networks
        - Security
        - Software Engineering
        - Systems
    - Select all courses from the two chosen PCCs, as they're specified in "`ALLEGATO 3`";
    - Include related courses ("`Insegnamenti Affini`") taken exclusively from "`ALLEGATO 2`" until all CFUs (including free-choice ones) are completed;
    - Include an **AFC**;
    - In the study plan notes, include the phrase: "`PERCORSO CONSIGLIATO`", specifying the names of the two selected PCCs.

2. **Custom Study Plan ("`PERCORSO FORMATIVO INDIVIDUALE`")**  
   Must be reviewed by the Academic Committee:
    - Choose **54 CFUs** from **any core courses** listed in the PCCs ("`ALLEGATO 1`");
    - Add **12 CFUs** of related courses from ANNEX 2 and **12 CFUs** of free-choice courses, ensuring that all required CFUs are completed.
    - Include an **AFC**;
    - Include **justifications** in the study plan notes for deviating from the recommended PCC-based structure, adding the phrase: "`PERCORSO INDIVIDUALE`".

### Important Details

- Each plan must also include **6 CFUs** of AFC ("Attività Formativa Complementare"—Supplementary Educational Activity);
- The remaining **36 CFUs** are dedicated to the thesis project;
- A recommended plan is highly encouraged as it guarantees automatic approval. Custom plans may require additional evaluation and are not guaranteed to be accepted.

### Submission and Revision Dates

Students can submit their study plan once a year during the following timeframe:
- From October 1st to November 30th of each year.

The committee will evaluate the submitted study plans periodically as follows:
- Plans submitted by October 10th will be reviewed by October 30th.
- Plans submitted after October 10th and by November 30th will be evaluated by December 31st.

Study plans, once approved for an academic year, cannot be modified within the same academic year.

We recommend to follow the courses for at least a month before making any final choice in order to avoid having to wait an entire academic year before making some changes. It's very frequent that students change ideas and might try other courses before making a definitive plan.

An already valid study plan can be revised in the following A.Y. by submitting a new plan that includes all previously approved courses.

### How can I submit it?
Study plans must be submitted using the online study plan submission system called "Percorsi Formativi," accessible from [Infostud](https://www.studenti.uniroma1.it/phoenix/index.html#/corsiLaurea/percorso_formativo).

#### Late Enrollement (>November 30th)

Students who authorized to enroll in the degree course after November 30th will have the opportunity to submit their study plan by February 28th of the following year (e.g. a student enrolled in December 2023 can submit by 28th February 2024).

Late-submitted study plans will be evaluated as follows:
- Plans submitted after November 30th and by January 15th will be reviewed by January 31st.
- Plans submitted after January 15th and by February 28th will be evaluated by March 31st.

### When Does an Approved Study Plan Come into Effect?

Study plans come into effect starting from the academic year in which they were submitted and remain in effect until a new substitute study plan is submitted and approved.
This means that if you are enrolled in the 24/25 A.Y in December 2025 you won't be able to take exams of the new study plan submitted in September 2025. You'll have to wait January 2026 to take the exams of the new study plan!

Exam sessions held from September to December belong to the previous academic year! Those can be used by students only to pass exams for courses that are part of their previously approved study plans for the past academic year!

## Can a study plan be rejected?
Yes, you will have to submit a new plan until it gets approved. There's not a plain rejection, usually an email explaining the reason why the plan was rejected is sent.

### How to avoid rejection?
As for 2024/25 A.Y. you can decide to follow some recommended study plans which will be automatically approved (find them [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kasq5efzmuVXt2SlMfGnvn1gUD5bD877/edit), although they might not reflect your full interests.
Alternatively, you can opt for an individual study plan which you might have to adjust, which will give you the freedom to build a very unique and diversified plan.

## Exams Ahead of Schedule
Once your study plan is approved you can virtually book all the exams and finish your Master's Degree in one semester. In practice if you book and pass an exam that you didn't attend yet, the administration might remove it from your career record. The dangerous part is the "might" because if they notice right before your graduation you might have to delayed it or worse, if they notice it after you graduated they can legally invalidate your degree.
This is not written anywhere explicitly so be careful.
If you want to anticipate an exam you might ask the professor to freeze the grade until you can "legally" book it and register the grade.

## Special Cases

Erasmus students who will spend a period abroad can seek the assistance of the study plan evaluation committee to immediately modify their study plan if they encounter serious administrative problems at the host institution.
Moreover, students who cannot attend courses provided in their study plan due to class overlaps or unforeseen changes in their schedule can seek the assistance of the study plan evaluation committee to make immediate changes to resolve such conflicts.

## Contacts

The study plan evaluation committee can open a support ticket on the [dedicated support page for the Master programme](https://support.mastercs.teaching.di.uniroma1.it/index.php) or by writing an e-mail to: mastercs_studyplans@di.uniroma1.it. The committee invites students not to ask questions whose answers are already present in the text above.

You will receive a response within about 30 days. Typically, the committee responds much faster when the study plan submission deadline approaches.
