As every university, Sapienza asks its students to partake to the exams related to the courses that the students followed during the lecture semesters. Usually, exams are held during the [exam sessions](../../../courses/calendar/#exams).

An exam session is a time period of 7/8 weeks in which professors allow their students to take the exams related to their subject. Except for the exam session of September and the extraordinary sessions (find more about it [here](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/content/esami-di-profitto)), all the sessions allow the students to take the exam up to two times.

You can sit for an exam as many times you want, and there is no penalty for that, **as long as you haven't accepted your grade**.

Assume you are a freshman in A.A. 2024/25 and you want to take an exam in the first semester of your first year. The professor will communicate two dates on which you will be able to take the exam, (say, for instance, the 10/01/2025 and the 03/02/2025). You can take the exam either on the first or in the second date.

Suppose that, for any reason, you can't take it in the first exam session (so in the winter one): you will be able to sit for that exam in **any other** exam session to which you are allowed to participate **until you pass the exam**.

## Types of exams

There are many types of exams, and they mostly depend on the subject that you do: some may be **oral** (which consist in a discussion with the professor over the topics studied in the course), some may be **written** (which could consist on a theoretical exam or a practical one), others may be **practical** (for instance if you have to make a project), and some may blend these modes together.

Some exams may ask you to first take a written exam and then an oral one (if you pass a certain grade threshold, if you pass the written one, etc...). It all depends on the professor, there is no common rule.

Mind that each professor has its own way to do an exam, so **pay attention** to the modalities that will be explained at the beginning and at the end of the course. Most importantly, **before asking to the professor** for something that it may have already said, check the course page on Moodle / Classroom / whichever platform first, or ask your colleagues eventually.

You will be able to find more information regarding which kind of exams you'll find in each course page.
